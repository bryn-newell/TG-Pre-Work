<!-- Comments can be added into all HTML files using < ! - - before the text and - - > after the
text (without extra spacing). It's a great way to make notes to yourself or other coders
about what is actually going on in your code and do title different sections of work.
Comments will be ignored by the browser and will not display on the webpage. They can also
be useful to test out blocks of code when they aren't fully functioning, but aren't ready
to be removed entirely yet.   -->
