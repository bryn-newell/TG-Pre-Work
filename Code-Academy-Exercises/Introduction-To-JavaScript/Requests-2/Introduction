In ES6 promises were added. A promise is an object that handles asynchronous data. A promise has three states:

pending : when a promise is created or waiting for data.
fulfilled : the asynchronous operation was handled successfully.
rejected : the asynchronous operation was unsuccessful.

Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, you can chain an additional method to the original promise
