var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = "You can make carbonara with " + pasta + ", " + meat + ", " + " and a sauce made with "
 + sauce + ".";

// ES6 is more similar to other OOP languages which can lead to less difficulty when moving between
// languages. The new syntax is often easier to understand and uses less characters to create the same
// functionality. ES6 also introduced solutions to many of the bugs ES5 had. Adoption by web developers
// occured quickly, but web browser support lagged behind. To limit the impact of browser issues, ECMA made
// ES6 backwards compatable.
