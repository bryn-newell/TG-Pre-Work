/* npm or node package manager are used to access and manage Node packages. Node packages are directories
that contain JavaScript code written by other developers. You can use these packages to reduce
duplication of work and avoid bugs. Before we can add Babel to our project directory, we need to run npm
init. The npm init command creates a package.json file in the root directory. A package.json file
contains information about the current JavaScript project. Including metadata such as a project title,
description, and author, as well as a list of node packages required for the project. If another developer
wants to run your project, npm looks inside package.json and downloads the packages in this list. It also
contains key-value pairs for command line scripts â€” You can use npm to run these shorthand scripts
to perform some process. When creating a package.json file you will be prompted to fill in some information.
You are not required to answer the prompts, though it is recommended at minimum, you add your own
title and description. If you don't want to fill in a field, you can press enter. npm will leave fill
these fields with default values or leave them empty when it creates the package.json file. */
