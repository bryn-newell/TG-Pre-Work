var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

const meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;

// There is a gap in between when programmers begin using new syntax and when browsers are compatable to
// understand and use it. caniuse.com and Babel are two great resources to address browsser compatability issues.
