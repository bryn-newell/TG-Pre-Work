{
  "presets": ["env"]
}

You can specify the initial JavaScript version inside of a file named .babelrc. In your root 
directory, you can run touch .babelrc to create this file. Inside .babelrc you need to define the
preset for your source JavaScript file. The preset specifies the version of your initial JavaScript file.
To specify that we are transpiling code from an ES6+ source, we have to add the following JavaScript
object into .babelrc:

{
  "presets": ["env"]
}
When you run Babel, it looks in .babelrc to determine the version of the initial JavaScript file.
In this case, ["env"] instructs Babel to transpile any code from versions ES6 and later.
