// An abstraction is a way of communicating a clear and consise idea while being able to take away or
// abstract a lot of the exact details. We can use abstraction in our coding through functions. We can also
// use higher-order functions as an abstraction too. Higher-order functions accept other functions as arguments
// and/or return functions as output.
