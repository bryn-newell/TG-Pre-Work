// Objects can be assigned to variables just like any other data type and are designated using curly braces {}.
// An object is filled with unordered data that is organized into key-value pairs. The key is like a variable
// name that points to a location in memory that holds a value. The value can be any other data type, including
// functions or another object. Key-value pairs are written as identifier:value and they are each separated with
// a comma. Keys are strings, but when we have a key that does not have any special characters in it, it can
// be written without quotation marks.
