/* A temperate literal is marked by wrapping it in back ticks ` `. Inside the temperate literal is a place
holder marked by ${} and the value of the place holder inside the curly braces is usually a variable name.
When the whole temperate literal is logged it interpolates the place holder and replaces it with the value
of the variable. Interpolation makes code much more legible and you don't have to  worry about escaping
single of double quotes */
