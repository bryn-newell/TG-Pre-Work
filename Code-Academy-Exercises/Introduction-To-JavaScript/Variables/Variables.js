// A variable is a container for a value such as a username and score or a greeting. It's also a good 
// way to label data with a descriptive name so our programs become more easily understood. Variables can be
// created with a descriptive name, store or update information, or have their value referenced. Var let and
// const are all keywords to create variables.
