// Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. Arrays in JS are zero-indexed, meaning
// the positions start counting from 0. An element can be accessed by typing the arrays name followed by [] with
// the brackets holding the index number. Bracket notation and the index can also be used to access individual
// characters in a string.
