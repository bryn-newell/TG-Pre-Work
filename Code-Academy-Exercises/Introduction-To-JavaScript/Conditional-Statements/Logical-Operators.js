// When working with booleans there are also logical operators. These are the and operator (&&),
// the or operator (||), and the the not operator or bang operator (!) With && BOTH conditions must be true.
// With || one condition OR the other must be true. The ! operator will reverse or negate the value of a boolean
// and pass back the other boolean.
