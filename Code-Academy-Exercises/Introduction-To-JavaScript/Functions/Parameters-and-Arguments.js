// Some functions can take inputs and use them to perform a task, these are called parameters and
// are defined inside the initial set of parentheses. Parameters can also be placeholders for information
// that will be passed in when the function is called. The values that are passed into the function are
// called arguments. Arguments can be passed in as variables or values. The order of parameters and
// arguments needs to stay the same when passing them in.
