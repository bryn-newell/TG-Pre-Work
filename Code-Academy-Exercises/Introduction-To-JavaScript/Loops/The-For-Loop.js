// A for loop includes and iterator variable that usually appears in all three expressions. It is initialized,
// checked against the stopping condition, and then assigned a new value on each loop iteration. The for loop
// contains three expressions separated by ; inside (). The initilization starts the loop and can declare
// the iterator variable. The stopping condition is what the variable is evaluated against. If it evaluates
// to true the code block will run and if its false the code will stop. The iteration statement is used
// to update the variable for each loop. The code block is held in {}.
