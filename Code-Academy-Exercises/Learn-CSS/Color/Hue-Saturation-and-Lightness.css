/* The syntax for the HSL property is similar to the RGB syntax. The first value represents the degree
of hue, between 0 and 360. 360 refers to the angle on a color wheel, with 0 being red, 120 being green,
240 being blue, and 360 being back to red again. The second and third values are percentages
representing saturation and lightness respectively. Saturation is the intensity of a color, the closer to 0
the more grey it becomes. And lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. 100% is closer to white,
while 0% is closer to black.  */
