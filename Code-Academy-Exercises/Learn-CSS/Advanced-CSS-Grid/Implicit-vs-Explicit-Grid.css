/* Defining the number of rows and columns of a grid is called an explicit grid. An implicit grid
has an algorithm built into the specification for CSS grid that determines the default behavior for the
the placement of elements when there are more that fit into the grid that was defined explicitly.
The default behavior is that items fill up rows then add new rows when necessary and are only as tall as
the content requires them to be.  */
