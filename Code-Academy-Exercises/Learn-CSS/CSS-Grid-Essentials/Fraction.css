/* CSS grid introduced a new relative sizing unit, fraction or fr. Using fr makes it much easier to prevent
the content of the grid from overflowing as each row or column can be defined of a fraction of the total
height or width. fr can also be used in combination with other units and the fraction will be determined
by what is left from the other units.  */
