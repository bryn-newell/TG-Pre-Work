<!-- Each HTML element has a default dipslay value that dictates if it can share horizontal space with
another element. The display property can be set to inline, block, or inline-block. Inline elements
have a box that wraps very tightly around the content, only taking up as much space as necessary and not
requiring a new line after it. Inline elements cannot be altered with height and width properties. Some
HTML tags are inline by default such as <em> <strong> and <a>. -->
